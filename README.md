<!-- # Repo-Template
This is an Internal WXSD Template to be used for GitHub Repos moving forward. Follow the steps below: For extended details, visit https://cisco.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/WXSD-WebexSolutionsDevelopment/Shared%20Documents/Onboarding%20Instructions%20%26%20Guides/Github%20%26%20Security/Github%20Readme%20Detailed%20Standards.docx?d=wba3225a5102341cf874d319d3f334b9b&csf=1&web=1&e=yggr2S 



<!--   Step 1) Name your repository: Repo Name must ALWAYS end with "bot", "embeddedapp: or "macro"
      Examples: "<insert repo name>-bot", "<insert repo name>-embeddedapp", "<insert repo name>macro"

      

~3 words, kebab case, use words to indicate what it does. Visit https://github.com/wxsd-sales/readme-template/blob/master/README.md for more details  
-->

<!--  Step 2) Add One sentence description to your repository: Copy/Paste from Webex Labs Card sentence.
       Example: "Redirect an Auto Attendant caller to an SMS conversation to alleviate Call Queue Agent responsibilities."
-->

<!--  Step 3) Add at least 1 tag to the repo: Indicating if it’s a “bot”, “macro” or “embeddedapp”.       
                 *Additional tags are allowed: should be lowercase and hyphenated for spaces.
                Repo does not use “macros” as a tag (use “macro” instead)
-->

<!--  Step 4) MAKE SURE an MIT license is included in your Repository. If another license is needed, verify with management. This is for legal reasons.
-->

<!--  Step 4) Use following Template to copy/paste your details below in place of the directions 
Make sure you include the "Keep this here" portions (it is for legal, and security infosec reasons).
